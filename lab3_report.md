## Section 3.1: Autoencoders and Stacked Autoencoders

### Q1. Conduct image reconstruction on synthetic handwritten digits dataset (MNIST) using an autoencoder. Note that you can tune the number of neurons in the hidden layer (encoding dim) of the autoencoder and the number of training epochs (n epochs) so as to obtain good reconstruction results. Can you improve the performance of the given model?.
